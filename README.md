# GD&amp;T Notes
I will write down some notable part of Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&amp;T)) here.  
Main resouse of my research/practice is [Technical Drawing for Product Design](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-60854-5?gclid=Cj0KCQiA64GRBhCZARIsAHOLriJH6Y5bBSntbcdIpl3zZXUVGDxex8WNRUO115z5Vrp7pKs_4wwdNRYaAv7KEALw_wcB)

## Chapter 1: Introducing GD&amp;T and GPS
* GD&amp;T: Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing
* GPS: Geometric Product Specification
* CMM: Coordinate Measuring Machine
* Each feature of a workpiece should be fully defined in terms of dimension, position, orientation and form.
* GD&amp;T is a tool that allows an imperfect geometry to be managed perfectly.
* Traditional Dimesioning: Using plus and minus for drawings spesification.
