# GD&amp;T Notes
I will write down some notable part of Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&amp;T)) here.  
Main resouse of my research/practice is [Technical Drawing for Product Design](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-60854-5?gclid=Cj0KCQiA64GRBhCZARIsAHOLriJH6Y5bBSntbcdIpl3zZXUVGDxex8WNRUO115z5Vrp7pKs_4wwdNRYaAv7KEALw_wcB)

## Chapter 1: Introducing GD&amp;T and GPS
* GD&amp;T: Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing
* GPS: Geometric Product Specification
* CMM: Coordinate Measuring Machine
* Each feature of a workpiece should be fully defined in terms of dimension, position, orientation and form.
* GD&amp;T is a tool that allows an imperfect geometry to be managed perfectly.
* Traditional Dimesioning: Using plus and minus for drawings spesification.

## Chapter 2: The Geometrical Product Specification (GPS) Language
* Standards: ISO17450, ISO1101, ISO14660
* Geometrical features domains according to the ISO 14660/1 standard
    * The specification domain (representations of the future workpiece - imaged by the designer)
    * The workpiece domain (the physical world domain)
    * The inspection domain (epresentation of a given workpiece is used through the sampling of the workpiece with measuring instruments)
* Geometrical features according to the ISO 17450/1 standard
    * Integral (real surface of a workpiece)
    * Associated (ideal feature that is established from a non-ideal model)
    * Derived (features that represent the model - not sure!)
